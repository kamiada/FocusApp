# FocusApp

Another small app to be done with use of React Native + Expo. 
The purpose of it is to make simple focus type of mobile application of iPhone (because I absolutely cannot deal with broken UX of some of them) and on improving my CSS skills.

The app is quite basic, but finally finished (more or less - functionality is there, styling could be improved) and it was pretty fun to do it.
